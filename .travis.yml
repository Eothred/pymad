# Setup (performed within virtualenv)
install:
  # We need to install cython here, since Travis uses the checkout from the
  # repository which doesn't contain ".c" source files (unlike the source
  # distribution from PyPI):
  - pip install cython

  # Check that the setup succeeds without having numpy installed first:
  - python setup.py install

  # Uninstall the package but leave the numpy installation untouched in
  # order to test the installation from the distribution later on:
  - pip uninstall cern-pymad --yes

  # Note that if we didn't have numpy installed at this point, the following
  # commands would recompile numpy another 3 times (once in sdist and twice
  # during the pip command)!

  # Now install the package again from the source distribution:
  - python setup.py sdist
  - pip install $(ls ./dist/*.tar.gz | sort -rV | head -n1)

# Actual tests:
script:
  - python test/cpymadtest/test_resource.py
  - python test/cpymadtest/test_madx.py
  - python test/cpymadtest/test_model_locator.py
  - python test/cpymadtest/test_survey.py
