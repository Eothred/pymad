CERN CPyMad
***********

CPyMad_ is a Cython_ binding to MAD-X_.

MAD-X is a software package to simulate particle accelerators and is used
at CERN and all around the world. It has its own proprietary scripting
language and is usually launched from the command line.

Feel free to report bugs, request features and ask questions on the
`issue pages`_.

There is also a binding via JMad_ called JPyMAD_. This has less features
but does not require a C compiler for installing.
