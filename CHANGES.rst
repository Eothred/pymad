Changelog

0.6
===

- raise exception and don't hang up anymore, if libmadx process crashes
- on python>=2.7, close handles in remote process properly
- let every 'Madx' instance have an independent copy of the madx library.
  this makes the madx module much more useful. previously, this was only
  true for instances of 'cpymad.model'.
- restrict to only one cython module that links to libmadx. (allows static
  linking which is advantageous on windows!)
- use YAML model files instead of JSON
- make 'madx' a submodule of 'cpymad'
- fix test exit status

0.5
