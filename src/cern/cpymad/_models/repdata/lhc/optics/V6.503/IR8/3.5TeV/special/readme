This "special" directory corresponds to a special case where the corrector MCBYH.5R8.B1( KICK := acbyhs5.r8b1)  in Q5 is not working.
It is replaced by another one in Q6: MCBCH.6R8.B1  (KICK := acbch6.r8b1)

This configuration is for startup 2010. Two horizontal MCBX correctors are used, but only one vertical MCBX corrector.
