The Squeeze files are made by E.Laface. O.B.

The MCBX corrector were discovered to be limited to 350A instead of the design value of 550A.
In order to get the same crossing angle and separation, more MCBX's are needed.
The MCBXH.3L8, MCBXH.3H8, MCBXV.3L8 and MCBXV.3L8 are now used for the squeeze.

The MCBX's are limited to 350A; 120A can be used for the squeeze(crossing angle and separation)
while 230A is reserved for closed orbit correction
