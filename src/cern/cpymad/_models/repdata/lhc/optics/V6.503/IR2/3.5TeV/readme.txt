 Added beta* = 0.50, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, 1.20, 1.40, 1.60 and 1.80  for studies and possible future implementation  12/1/2011 T.R
 Calculated crossing and separation scheme for beta* = .50, 0.60, 0.80, 1.00, 1.20, 1.40, 1.60 and 1.80.          13/1/2011 E.L.
 Added beta* = 2.25 and 2.75, because beta-beating was too high ~ 3% between beta*=2 and beta*=3.                 14/1/2011 T.R.
 Calculated crossing and separation scheme for beta* = 2.25 and 2.75.                                             17/1/2011 E.L.
 Added crossing and separation scheme for beta* =0.70, 0.90, 1.10, 1.50, 1.90                                      7/2/2011 O.B.
